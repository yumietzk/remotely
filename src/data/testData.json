We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We ❤️ startups &amp; SMBs. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM  that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or complex UI. Our goal: double the productivity of every sales rep.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Our backend <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>tech stack</u></a> currently consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>TaskTiger</u></a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://developer.close.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>public API</u></a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using AWS tools, Terraform, and Ansible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We ❤️ open sourcing our code and ideas on <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://github.com/closeio\" rel=\"nofollow\">our GitHub</a> and on <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://making.close.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Making of Close</a>, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.

A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.
